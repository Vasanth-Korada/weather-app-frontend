# Weather Wonder Frontend (React, MUI)

This React application serves as the frontend interface for accessing the Weather Backend Service. It offers functionalities like fetching weather details, maintaining a history of weather searches, and user management features such as login, registration, and logout.

## Features

- **User Management**: Provides registration, login, and logout capabilities.
- **Weather Search**: Allows users to search for weather details based on city names.
- **Weather History**: Users can view and manage their past weather search records.
- **Update Weather**: Users can update either temperature, latitude or longitude with ease in the Weather Search History Data Table.
- **Delete Weather**: Users can delete a particular weather record in the weather search history table.
- **Protect Routes**: Added route protection to the Weather Search Route. Users cannot access important routes without authentication.
- **Open Weather Map API**: Utilized OpenWeather API to fetch current weather with user-entered city name
- **CRUD Operations**: Enables creating, reading, updating, and deleting weather records via the backend API.
